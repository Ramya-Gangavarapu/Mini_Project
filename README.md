# OBJECTIVES

1. To design an efficient robot.
2. To solve the maze.
3. To understand the algorithm of TI Microcontrollers.
4. To verify the robot path.
5. To perform smooth movement.
6. To overcome the turns and loops of the path detected by the robot.
7. To ensure software efficiency.
8. To provide a good interaction between the microcontroller and other mechanical 
elements.
9. To reach the final destination after overcoming the obstacles by the robot.
10. To determine its shortest path.

# INTRODUCTION

• Path planning and navigation are crucial for overcoming the challenges in 
robotics. 

• The project's vision is to develop an unique MAZE SOLVING ROBOT WITH ML and 
that can be implemented using Texas Instruments Robotic System Learning Kit (TI 
RSLK) and Code Composer Studio Version 8. 

• In a maze, a robot can find its way through a series of paths and hedges designed 
to replicate a puzzle where it has to find its way. 

• As it approaches an obstacle, the robot reverses itself and stops, and then moves 
through a parameter involving 90-degree turns and loops. 

• Additionally, the TI Microcontroller, which controls the robot's actions, is an 
important component of a robot's brain. 

• This course project involves programming and exposure to GPIOs, 
analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), timers, periodic interrupts, and pulse-width 
modulation (PWM) with microcontrollers in order to ensure that all components 
work together correctly.

# ADVANTAGES

• Auto accidents are reduced by robotic cars.

• A human driver's reaction time will be slower compared 
to an autonomous vehicle.

• A safer driving environment will allow them to drive 
more quickly.

• Shortening the journey time can be accomplished by 
raising the speed limit to reflect safer driving.

# OUTCOMES
1. During the program, we learned how to program LEDs,
motors, bumper switches, timers, and interrupts.
2. The robot can be programmed to search for treasure in a
90-degree turn and loopless black-and-white maze.

# FUTURE ADVANCEMENTS

An exploration of path planning and navigation in a 
known or unknown environment in order to find the 
collision-free path from a given location to a given goal 
position.

# CONCLUSION

In this work, experiential modules are used to demonstrate the utility of 
Texas Instruments Robotic System Learning Kit (TI RSLK) for maze 
design. There is no need for microcontroller programming knowledge to use 
the experiential modules. Students are expected to be more motivated and 
able to cope with this math-intensive course if these experiential modules are 
included as part of the course. In the future, we plan on developing an 
AI-based Maze solving robot using the programming knowledge we have 
acquired. Thanks to TEXAS INSTRUMENTS.
